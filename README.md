    <h3>Your Website Description</h3>
    This assignment provides opportunities to use JavaScript in a creative environment. The end product is a
    dynamic website with modern styling and interesting event handling.
    <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
    <p>In HW2 you added styling to your static website using CSS, including some CSS preprocessing. Now your objective
        is to <strong>add user interactions</strong> to your site using JavaScript! You should <strong>consider the
            topic and theme</strong> to add events appropriately.</p>
    <p>You are free to add additional HTML and CSS content to make your site more complete. If you wish to choose a
        different topic than you submitted for HW2, you must create new HTML and CSS for that topic.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Add at least 4 total events</strong> from the following categories, covering at least 2 different
        categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>DOM Manipulation (adding, removing, and/or changing HTML content)</li>
        <li>Client-Side Data (File upload, Cookies, WebStorage, IndexedDB)</li>
        <li>Retrieve online data using Fetch API (and JSON if needed)</li>
        <li>Form Validation and Processing</li>
        <li>Drag N' Drop</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h3>Additional Exercise - API Collection</h3>
    <p>
        In addition the requirements above, complete the following exercise that involves JavaScript classes/prototypes
        and the Fetch API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a new file <strong>api_explore.html</strong>. <strong>Choose an API</strong> from <a
            href="https://rapidapi.com/">RapidAPI</a>. Here are the <a
            href="https://rapidapi.com/blog/most-popular-api/">top 50 most popular APIs</a> from the site. Design and
        write an appropriate JavaScript <strong>class</strong> to hold the data. Write a <strong>Fetch request</strong>
        to retrieve data from the chosen API and <strong>save</strong> data into instances of the class.
        <strong>Display</strong> data from the class instances onto a web page or the console. Lastly, write a function
        to search for an item in the saved data and return true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to use an API outside of RapidAPI, show the API to your instructor to verify it is acceptable first.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Practice and Git Requirements</h2>
    <p>Use <strong>best practice</strong> for all JavaScript contents. Examples of best practice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Considerate variable declarations using const, let, and var.</li>
        <li>Appropriate comparisons with == or ===.</li>
        <li>Add function parameter default values for any parameters that may not be specified.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use <strong>appropriate Git practice</strong>  to complete the homework. Create a branch to work on each page, and merge branches into main via a pull request. You may complete your own pull requests for this assignment.
